[**Shape Ripple**](https://github.com/poldz123/ShapeRipple) is a library that emulates a ripple like animations with cool tweaks
on the go. It runs on [API level 11](https://android-arsenal.com/api?level=11) and upwards.

As addition you can even create your own shape renderer through the canvas to create a custom shape ripple.

Demo
======
For a brief overview of the library you can download the app in **Google PlayStore** [**Shape Ripple apk**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rodolfonavalon.shaperipple) and try it out. The apk code for this demo app is located in the **ShapeRippleExample folder**

All Available Attributes
=======

Attributes | Effect
------------ | -------------
`ripple_color` | **color**  *color of the base ripple*
`enable_single_ripple` | **boolean**  *flag for enabling the single ripple only*
`ripple_duration` | **millisecond**  *the duration of each ripple animation*
`enable_color_transition` | **boolean**  *flag for enabling the color transition*
`enable_random_position` | **boolean**  *flag for enabling the random positining of ripple in the view*
`enable_random_color` | **boolean**  *flag for enabling the random coloring for each ripple*
`enable_stroke_style` | **boolean**  *flag for enabling the stroke style for each ripple*
`ripple_from_color` | **color**  *starting color for the color transition of the ripple*
`ripple_to_color` | **color**  *end color for the color transition of the ripple*
`ripple_stroke_width` | **dimension**  *base stroke width for each of the ripple*
`ripple_maximum_radius` | **dimension**  *maximum radius of each of the ripples*
`ripple_count` | **integer**  *number of ripples to be rendered*

Customizing Ripples
=======
Customizing the ripple is easy. You can create a class that extends [**BaseShapeRipple**](https://github.com/poldz123/ShapeRipple/blob/master/ShapeRippleLibrary/src/main/java/com/rodolfonavalon/shaperipplelibrary/model/BaseShapeRipple.java) and fill out the:

`onSetup(Context context, Paint shapePaint)`
- This is called only once before any rendering happens, good for loading data/resources.

`onDraw(Canvas canvas, int x, int y, float radiusSize, int color, int rippleIndex, Paint shapePaint)`
- This draws the actual ripple to the canvas. You can create your custom shapes here whatever you want.

For full documentation of the of the methods above go the the [**BaseShapeRipple**](https://github.com/poldz123/ShapeRipple/blob/master/ShapeRippleLibrary/src/main/java/com/rodolfonavalon/shaperipplelibrary/model/BaseShapeRipple.java) class.

Usage
=======
You can select which options you want to use:

**1. JCenter dependency(Recommended)**

- Add it to your app `build.gradle`:

```gradle
dependencies {
    compile 'com.rodolfonavalon:ShapeRippleLibrary:1.0.0'
}
```

**2. Gradle maven dependency**

- Add it to your app `build.gradle`:

```gradle
repositories {
    maven {
        url 'https://dl.bintray.com/poldz123/maven/'
    }
}

...

dependencies {
    compile 'com.rodolfonavalon:ShapeRippleLibrary:1.0.0'
}
```

**3. arr file only**
 - Down the [**latest arr file**](https://github.com/poldz123/ShapeRipple/releases) from the release section
 - Copy the latest arr file to your `libs` folder of your Android Application
 - Start using the library

**4. Clone whole repository**
 - Open your **commandline-input** and navigate to the desired destination folder on your machine (where you want to place the library)
 - Use the command `https://github.com/poldz123/ShapeRipple.git` to download the full ShapeRipple repository to your computer (this includes the folder of the library as well as the folder of the example project)
 - Import the library folder (`ShapeRippleLibrary`) into Android Studio (recommended) or your Eclipse workspace
 - Add it as a reference to your project:
   - [referencing library projects in Eclipse](http://developer.android.com/tools/projects/projects-eclipse.html#ReferencingLibraryProject)
   - [managing projects from Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/create-project.html)
